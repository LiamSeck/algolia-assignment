### Data Manipulation

1. Checked both JSON and CSV files to confirm correct structure and correct number of objects/enteries.
2. Noticed the `restaurants_info.csv` was using `;` instead of `,`
3. Carried out a find and replace for `;` to `,`
4. Then converted `restaurants_info.csv` to JSON using `csvtojson` located [here](https://github.com/LiamSeck/algolia-assignment/tree/main/csvtojson).
5. I then imported both JSON files in an index using the Algolia dashboard.
